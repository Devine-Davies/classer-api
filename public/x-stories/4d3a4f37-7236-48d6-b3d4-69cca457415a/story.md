# Top 5 action cam angles you’re probably not using

Most action cam users stick to the usual suspects: helmet cams, chest mounts, and maybe a selfie stick. But you can also get more creative, here are five **underused action cam angles** that make your edits more immersive and creative.

## 1. Reverse POV (Facing you)

- **Mounting idea:** Handlebar mount, board tail, or backpack strap with swivel arm.
- **Use case:** Biking, skating, surfing, skiing, or climbing.
- **Why it works:** Most POV footage shows what you *see*, but this shows *you. Y*our reactions, movements, and grit. It makes the viewer feel like they’re right there with you.

> Pro tip: Use a wide lens or Max Lens Mod for GoPro to capture both your face and the background. Great for storytelling edits and thumbnails.
> 

**Suggested Gear:**

- [GoPro Max](https://amzn.to/42Fk6F0) or [DJI Action 4](https://amzn.to/43WcSPo) with wide FOV
- [Handlebar clamps](https://amzn.to/3Ez2Qt7)

## 2. Foot-level or pedal mount

- **Mounting idea:** Strap-on mounts for shoes, bike cranks, skateboard decks.
- **Use case:** Skateboarding, biking, trail running, parkour.
- **Why it works:** Captures a hyper-dynamic feel, think spinning wheels, dirt flying, or foot impacts. Adds a raw, high-speed perspective to your shots.

> Editing tip: Use slow motion or hyperlapse to exaggerate movement.
> 

**Suggested Gear:**

- [GoPro HERO12](https://amzn.to/4jF2eRF) with stabilisation
- 360-degree sticky mounts or GoPro “The Strap” for limbs

## 3. Mouth or chin mount

- **Mounting idea:** Mouth grip for water sports or chin mount on a helmet.
- **Use case:** Surfing, skiing, motocross, mountain biking.
- **Why it works:** Gives a tight, immersive first-person view with less head movement shake than forehead or helmet cams.

> Why surfers love it: Keeps your hands free and provides an organic perspective, especially when duck diving or hitting waves.
> 

**Suggested Gear:**

- [GoPro Hero](https://amzn.to/3Y7pj7c)
- [Dango Chin Mount](https://amzn.to/4lF7Tc8)

## 4. Low pole angle (Camera pointing up)

- **Mounting idea:** Extendable pole held low, or fixed to gear looking upward.
- **Use case:** Hiking, skiing, snowboarding, or B-roll shots.
- **Why it works:** It exaggerates scale, makes you look towering, heroic, and epic. Also great for dust/snow spray and ground interaction shots.

> Creative idea: Film a "walk-over" shot where the subject passes directly over the cam.
> 

**🎯 Suggested Gear:**

- [Insta360 X4](https://amzn.to/4jH0G9R) (for reframing flexibility)
- [Short tripod sticks](https://amzn.to/4lF7XZq)

## 5. Third-Person Boom (backpack or shoulder mount)

- **Mounting idea:** Backpack with a rear-facing boom arm or 3rd-person rig.
- **Use case:** Hiking, biking, snowboarding, or FPV-style content.
- **Why it works:** Feels like a video game, like you're watching yourself from behind. Great for cinematic tracking shots.

> Watch out for: Overhead clearance and weight balance on intense activities.
> 

**Suggested Gear:**

- [Magnetic Clip GoPro Hero](https://amzn.to/4cK3JvC)
