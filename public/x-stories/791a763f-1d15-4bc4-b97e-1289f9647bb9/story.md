### You wonâ€™t find good accessories for it

First off, don't expect a treasure trove of accessories with these cheaper options. You might find yourself missing out on things like mounts or good cases that could enhance your filming experience.

### The truth about been waterproof

When comes about capturing moments in the pool or underwater, budget cameras may not work as good as more expensive ones as they might lack the necessary waterproofing and durability features.

### Getting a nice light

Don't count on stellar performance in low-light conditions. These cameras might struggle to capture clear footage when there is low light or too much light. It wonâ€™t calibrate property.

### The struggles of the battery

You might find yourself constantly looking for a power outlet or carrying around spare batteries to keep the action rolling. And even when they do have battery, don't expect marathon recording sessions. 

### Their durability

Action cameras are built to withstand the bumps, scrapes, and tumbles that come with life on the go but that comes with a price. These cameras tend to have a limit of durability, meaning are less stable. 

### No added telemetry

While it's not a necessity for everyone, pricier action cameras often come with the ability to track your GPS and provide data like your speed. It's not a must-have feature, but it's certainly a nice bonus to have if you're interested in keeping track on your adventures.

### Summary

If you're just testing the waters to see if action cameras are your thing, go ahead and give them a shot. My first action camera was a budget one, and while it didn't last long, it helped me realize how much I enjoyed capturing my adventures. Eventually, I upgraded to a better camera from one of the top brands, and the difference was like night and day. So, don't be afraid to start small and work your way up if you find yourself hooked on the action camera experience!
