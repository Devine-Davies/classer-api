# What is the environmental education movement?

The first Earth Day was on April 22, 1970 catalyzed the modern environmental education movement. Environmental education is about more than simply learning a few facts and figures:

- It has the power to transform lives and society.
- It informs and inspires.
- It influences attitudes.
- It motivates action.

Environmental education is a key tool in expanding the constituency for the environmental movement and creating healthier and more civically-engaged communities.

 It has been commonly thought that the best way to engage people with an environmental statement is to immerse them in experiences in the natural environment that enable them to observe habitats, wildlife and the impact of environmental problem

### **People learn best through experience**

When it comes to nature, my experience has shown this is an one-way street. Only through experience and connection you can learn to appreciate it.

### **Education should be inspiring**

While environmental education programs work to spread knowledge and share positive attitudes towards conservation, its goal is also to inspire participants to take some kind of action. For instance, environmental educational programs should include classroom activities and incorporate hands-on demonstrations. 

The purpose of environmental education is to spread knowledge of endangered species, promote sustainable behaviour and foster positive attitudes towards these animals. Empowerment is key to link wildlife education to environmental action

### How **virtual reality and action cameras can change environmental education**

Environmental education can be improved through the creation of virtual field trips. These trips allow individuals to explore natural environments, such as rainforests or coral reefs, without having to physically travel to these locations. This not only saves time and money, but also allows individuals to experience environments that may be difficult or impossible to visit in person, such as remote or endangered ecosystems.

In addition to providing immersive experiences thanks to action cameras like a gopro, insta360 or DJI, VR technology can also be used to simulate potential future scenarios. For example, VR can be used to show people what a particular environment might look like if it were to be impacted by climate change. This can help people understand the potential consequences of environmental degradation and motivate them to take action to prevent it.

### Summary

Consider this example that had the potential to be inspiring but fell short: In 2006, the former UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, gathered attention for cycling to work for making an eco-friendly choice and publicly promoting his green agenda. However, the credit turned into a spectacle when the media found out that as he cycled, a car would follow him carrying his shoes and briefcase. This incident raises the question: Are we really taking this seriously?

We should try to consciously cultivate critical thinking skills ourselves. Instead of asking why so much litter exists, ask why companies insist on packaging all their products in cheap harmful plastic.
