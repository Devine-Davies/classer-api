# A Conversation with Dennis on MTB, mental health and growth

Meet Dennis, a lifelong rider who transitioned from BMX to mountain biking. He’s been sharing his MTB journey on YouTube for a couple of years and in this chat, Dennis talks about his first ride, the supportive MTB community, and how biking has helped him grow. 

**What got you into mountain biking, and what keeps you hooked?**

Been riding bikes since the age of 3 years old and used to race BMX back in the late 90’s. MTB was the next progression after I saw a couple of YouTube videos in my late 20’s. What keeps me hooked is being out in the wilderness and keeping myself grounded.

**Do you remember your first MTB ride and bike? What was that experience like?**

First MTB ride was in a real XC oriented place, but it was amazing to be out there. My first bike was a Giant Talon hardtail, paid way too much for it at the tail end of covid. It was much harder of a challenge than I remember, but after the ride, I couldn’t wait to get back.

**You started your [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DennyJannettyMTB) about two years ago, what inspired you to begin sharing your MTB journey online?**

Never really intended for it to be anything more than a place to put my videos. Some people seemed to enjoy my Bike Park videos. Slowly moving into doing some voiceover work. Now, it’s just to continue to grow relationships and spread positivity in a world filled with crappy content.

**I remember when I first started biking, there were a lot of ups and downs, and it was all about learning from those failures. Mountain biking often requires trial and error. How do you handle those tough days when things don’t go as planned, and what motivates you to push through setbacks?**

I’m a pretty outgoing person, but I’m also super risk adverse. I don’t mind being loud and outgoing, but within my comfort zone. What motivates me to push on is the wanting to continue to bring myself out of that shell. There’s plenty of features I know I have and can ride, but mentally I can’t get over them. Having tough days are normal, and not allowing them to mentally defeat you is tough. Having a great support group and the ability to trust yourself and others helps.

**The MTB community is known for being supportive (at least that’s been my experience!). What’s your perspective on the MTB community? Do you enjoy being part of a group of riders, or do you lean more towards a solo approach when it comes to your riding?**

I wouldn’t be where I am without my riding group. I wouldn’t ever get out of my comfort zone without them. Multiple people have pushed me towards things I may have rode around or not even tried. I love a good solo ride and getting lost in the woods is amazing, but stomping an awesome feature surrounded by some of my best friends is beyond words.

**You’ve mentioned in your videos how mountain biking has positively impacted your mental health. What do you think it has taught you about yourself, and how has that influenced other areas of your life?**

Mountain biking has taught me I’ve got a lot more of me to give. I’ve had a hard time “being uncomfortable” but through riding I’ve been able to be more okay with it. No matter how much my brain says “no don’t do it” there’s nothing more rewarding than pushing through it and landing it. A lot of people aren’t comfortable talking about their feelings and how they things make them feel and I aim to try and normalize it.

**I imagine you capture a lot of footage. How do you organise and edit your videos? Could you share some details about your workflow and the setup you use for your action camera?**

Most of the time I put them in files and put them by each day I ride and organize them by date. When I don’t need them I put them in an external drive for safe keeping.

**If you could collaborate with any MTB creator or brand, who would it be and why? (Maybe you can give us some ideas for Classer! hah)**

[Sam Pilgrim](https://www.youtube.com/sampilgrim), dude is so stoked to just be alive and I’d just want to hang out with him and ride.

**Mountain biking can be tough, especially when you're struggling to find the motivation to ride or start overthinking. What advice would you give to someone just starting out in MTB who’s having trouble finding the drive to get out on the trails?**

Just do it. Find a place that’s within your skill gap, and just ride. Joining local groups or just running into people on the trails is the best way to make friends. MTB solo is awesome, but it takes on another level when you ride around like minded people.

**Where do you see your content going in the future? Any specific goals for your YouTube channels?**

Probably more of the same. Raw trail footage, and some voiceover video essay type stuff. I tried doing the podcast and some list type things, but it felt too forced and I didn’t enjoy them. I don’t like chasing trends or doing things that I think others would like. 

**To wrap things up, what would you say is the best moment you’ve ever captured with your action camera?**

That’s a good one, tough to say, but if I was to narrow it down, probably landing a big step down at the local bike park after being towed in by my buddy Chris. Got the landing and celebration on camera and it wasn’t so genuine. 

A huge thanks to Dennis for sharing his journey with us! His story is a reminder of the power of pushing boundaries, both on and off the trails. You can catch more of Dennis’s MTB adventures and content on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DennyJannettyMTB). Thanks again Dennis!
