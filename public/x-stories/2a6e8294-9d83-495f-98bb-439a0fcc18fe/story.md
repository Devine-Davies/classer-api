### What to Look for in a Hiking Action Camera

When choosing an action camera for hiking, it's important to consider the specific demands of outdoor environments. Here are the key factors to keep in mind:

1. **Durability:** Hiking often involves exposure to rough conditions, so your camera needs to be tough. Look for cameras that are waterproof, dustproof, and shockproof. 

2. **Portability:** Weight and size matter when you're on the trail. Consider models that can easily fit in a pocket or attach securely to your gear.

3. **Battery Life:** Hiking can last for hours, and you don't want your camera dying in the middle of an adventure. Look for a camera with long battery life or one that supports swappable batteries, so you can keep filming without interruption. Solar chargers or portable power banks are also useful accessories to extend battery life.

4. **Image and Video Quality:** Look for cameras with at least 4K video resolution and features like image stabilisation to ensure smooth, high-quality footage. A good sensor and wide dynamic range will help you capture clear, vibrant images, even in varying lighting conditions.

5. **Field of View (FOV):** A wide field of view can help capture the vastness of landscapes, making it ideal for hiking. Some cameras offer adjustable FOV settings, allowing you to switch between wide-angle and more focused shots depending on the scene.

6. **Ease of Use:** When you're on the move, you need a camera that's easy to operate. Look for intuitive controls, responsive touchscreens, and features like voice commands, which allow you to control the camera hands-free.

7. **Mounting Options:** Ensure that the camera is compatible with a wide range of mounts and accessories.
