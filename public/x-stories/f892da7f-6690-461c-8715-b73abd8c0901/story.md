# A conversation with Andy from ProjectGo

Get to know Andy, the mind behind [ProjectGo](https://projectgo.pro/), in our latest interview. We had the chance to learn about his journey from being an Electrical Engineer to creating a go-to resource for action camera users. Andy shared how his passion for travel led him to explore action cameras and start his own [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@project-go) channel. He also discussed the challenges users often face and offered his insights on the latest trends in the industry. Check out our interview to hear Andy’s story!

**Can you tell us a bit about yourself and how you got started with action cameras? I know you began ProjectGo about 8 years ago while traveling and that you have a YouTube channel too. What inspired you to start this project?**

Absolutely! I've always had a passion for capturing the world around me, especially during my travels. About 8 years ago, after leaving my full-time job as an Electrical Engineer, I went on a solo journey through Southeast Asia. I found myself constantly engaging in action-packed activities like snorkeling, scuba diving, and motorbiking, and I wanted to document these incredible experiences. That’s when I discovered action cameras—they were compact, rugged, and perfectly suited to the adventurous lifestyle I was living. Starting [ProjectGO](https://projectgo.pro/) became my way of sharing these experiences and tips with others who were just as passionate about action cameras. The YouTube channel followed as a visual platform to connect with people and guide them through the ins and outs of using these versatile cameras.

**What do you think is the most common thing people find tricky about using action cameras, especially when they’re new to it?**

One of the most common challenges for beginners is getting the settings right. People often struggle with figuring out which settings work best for different environments or activities. Action cameras are powerful, but they can also be a bit overwhelming with all the different modes and features. Another tricky part is editing—knowing how to assemble all the clips together to create an engaging story can be a learning curve.

**I believe your first action camera was the Hero 6. How do you think action camera technology has changed since then? What do you think the future looks like for action cameras and outdoor videos?**

My very first action camera was the GoPro Hero 4, which didn’t last me very long. A few years later, I upgraded to the Hero 6 to document my year of travel around Southeast Asia. Since the Hero 4, action camera technology has made remarkable progress. We’ve seen major advancements in stabilization, image quality, and overall durability. Features like HyperSmooth and 4K video have truly raised the bar. Looking ahead, I believe we’ll see even more AI integration, possibly more immersive VR experiences, and cameras that are even more intuitive, making it easier for anyone to capture high-quality footage with minimal effort.

**There’s been a lot of debate about GoPro dropping GPS from the Hero 12. What are your thoughts on this decision? Do you see it as a strategic move from a business perspective?**

The decision to drop GPS from the Hero 12 has certainly sparked some conversations. From a user’s perspective, GPS can be a valuable tool, especially for those who love tracking their adventures. However, I can see how GoPro might be focusing on other features that they believe add more value to their core users. It could be a strategic move to streamline the camera's design or improve battery life, for example. It’s always a balancing act between adding features and keeping the product sleek and user friendly.

**Focusing on your projects, what made you start creating [courses](https://projectgo.pro/school/) about action cameras? Was it your experience of figuring things out on your own during your travels that made you realise others might need help too?**

When I first started using action cameras, there was definitely a learning curve. I spent a lot of time experimenting and figuring things out on my own, and I realized that a lot of people might appreciate some guidance. That’s what inspired me to create courses—helping others get up to speed quickly so they can enjoy capturing their adventures without the frustration of trial and error. It’s all about making the learning process smoother and more enjoyable.

**I saw that you sell a package for colour editing called [GoPro LUTs: The Cinematic Pack](https://projectgo.pro/gopro-luts/). It seems perfect for people who aren't editing experts or just want something quick and easy. Was that your goal when you created it?**

Yes, that was definitely the goal! I wanted to create something that would make it easy for anyone to enhance their footage, even if they don’t have a lot of editing experience. The LUTs are designed to give your videos that cinematic feel with just a few clicks. It’s all about making the editing process accessible and helping people achieve great results without spending hours editing.

**What are your future plans for [ProjectGo](https://projectgo.pro/)? Do you have any new courses or projects in the pipeline?**

I’m always looking for new ways to add value to the ProjectGo community. There are some exciting projects in the works, including new course modules that delve deeper into advanced techniques and possibly expanding into other forms of content creation. We’re also eager to test and review the latest action cameras and drones expected to be released in the coming months, especially those with promising AI features. The goal is to continue evolving and providing resources that help people maximize their use of action cameras.

**I imagine you collect a lot of videos; how do you organise and edit them? Could you share a bit about your workflow?**

Organization is key when you’re dealing with a lot of footage. I usually start by downloading the clips from my SDs to hard drives. I like to categorize my videos by date, location and activity, which makes it easier to find what I need later. For editing, I like to use Final Cut Pro as my main video editor. Then I select the best clips and import them to the video editor, then move on to adding music, cutting and trimming the footage, color grading and fine-tuning the details. Having a consistent workflow helps keep the process efficient and ensures that I can produce high-quality content regularly.

**Which action camera would you recommend to someone just starting out, given your experience in the sector?**

For beginners, I recommend any of the recent GoPro Hero models (10, 11, or 12), depending on your budget. These cameras are user-friendly and come with many automated settings that make it easy to capture great shots without needing to get too technical. Insta360 and DJI action cameras are also excellent alternatives and can sometimes be more affordable than GoPro. However, since GoPro remains the leading action camera on the market, you'll find a wider range of accessories and more extensive resources available for it.

**I have to ask, is GoPro your favourite brand? Especially since your first action cam was a Hero 4.**

GoPro definitely has a special place in my heart, especially since it was my first action camera. They’ve set the standard for the industry in many ways. But I’m also always excited to see what other brands bring to the table—competition drives innovation, and that’s great for everyone.

**To finish, what’s the best moment you’ve ever recorded with your action camera? What's your favourite activity to capture with your action camera?**

That’s a tough one! There have been so many incredible moments. One of the most memorable was capturing the vibrant underwater world in Indonesia during my scuba diving course. As for my favorite activity, I love capturing anything outdoors—whether it’s hiking, biking, or just exploring new places. Having the GoPro mounted on my chest is perfect for staying low-profile and effortlessly capturing spontaneous moments with people.
