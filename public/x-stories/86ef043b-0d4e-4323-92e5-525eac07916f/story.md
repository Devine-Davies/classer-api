Let‚Äôs be real if you check best motorcycle action camera out there, you will find plenty of action camera brands telling you ‚Äúpick me, pick me, I‚Äôm the best!‚Äù but are they? Here the Classer crew have done some research and this is what we found.

### Why to buy an action camera

Buying an action camera is a wise choice as it enhances both safety and enjoyment. It serves as a valuable tool for recording rides, providing evidence in case of accidents or disputes, and capturing scenic journeys for personal memories. Additionally, it promotes responsible riding by encouraging riders to focus on their behaviour, leading to improved skills and safer road habits. 

### **Must-haves for motorcyclists**

- A robust and durable camera, it‚Äôs important to make sure that it can take a beating.
- Waterproof camera. Others will require a case or cover in order to better survive. This is one of those categories where you get what you pay for. You might be able to find a no-name action camera for cheap but chances are, even with a case, you‚Äôre going to end up replacing it after the first big tumble or rainstorm.
- Good quality
- Stabilisation. Nobody likes shaky motorcycle footage. It‚Äôs nauseating to watch and it rarely captures the way a ride actually feels. You can always try and stabilise it afterwards using an editing program
- Battery life: How quickly your camera battery drains is usually correlated to the type of image capturing you‚Äôre doing. Snapping some photos in your driveway will require significantly less battery power than constantly filming a road trip at a high resolution as 4K.

Said this, let‚Äôs compare 3 different type of action cameras:

### 1. GoPro 11

GoPro is one of that brands that doesn‚Äôt need introduction, everyone knows them, but in this occasion we are focusing on GoPro 11 and not 12, why? Because in GoPro 12 they got rid of GPS, although they kept the telemetry, and as motorcyclists we believe it‚Äôs quite cool to be able to see where have you been riding, yeah it‚Äôs not a must, but it‚Äôs cool! Also it‚Äôs cheaper than GoPro 12 ;) 

GoPro 11 has an advanced video stabilization for smooth footage it‚Äôs called¬†HyperSmooth 5.0¬†feature. HyperSmooth works by intelligently zooming in when detecting shakiness. By zooming in, the Hero 11 is able to stabilise jittery footage easily. 

The GoPro Hero 11 Black also comes with the new¬†8:7 aspect ratio, which allows you to capture more vertical footage, perfect for showcasing your motorcycle adventures on social media.

### 2. Insta360 X3

If you want a camera to be mounted on your motorcycle body, such as the¬†handlebar, bumper, gas tank, or tail, then the Insta360 X3 is a great option. With a¬†360-degree lens, the camera offers 360-degree footage that you can¬†reframe later to create regular videos from any angle you want, including your POV, a third-person view of yourself, or even a side view. This means greater flexibility and versatility to your footage, and you won't miss any of the action happening around you.

In terms of tech specs, it boasts immersive 5.7K 360 video, a wide-angle 4K Single-Lens Mode, and features like FlowState Stabilization and 360 Horizon Lock. Despite the advanced capabilities, the Insta360 X3 is quite easy to use; control buttons are large, responsive, and easy to press even when on the move or gloved up.¬†

### 3. Akaso **V50 Elite**

The cheapest one from the 3. The Akaso V50 Elite is a recommended action camera if you're on a budget but still want a quality camera to capture your motorcycle adventures. it delivers high-quality¬†4K video resolution too.

The Akaso V50 Elite also comes with¬†Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) 2.0 and a¬†170-degree wide-angle lens, which means that you can capture stable and steady footage, even at high speeds.

And works under-water too üôÇ
