# Which action cameras have GPS and telemetry

Picture yourself reliving that moment when you were mountain biking or kayaking, not just watching the footage, but with detailed insights into your speed, altitude changes, and the exact path you did, how cool is that?

This is made possible through the feature known as telemetry, which captures data onto your footage. While the term 'telemetry' might sound unfamiliar to some, it makes a huge difference for action camera enthusiasts. Telemetry transforms recordings into immersive experiences, offering valuable context and improving the storytelling potential of your adventures. However, to access all this data, you'll need to find software that lets you dive into the details (we'll check this later!).

In this article, we'll explore the world of action cameras provided with GPS and telemetry capabilities, introducing how these features upgrade the way we capture and relive our favourite moments.”

### Exploring telemetry data

As we said, telemetry data goes beyond simply recording footage; it adds layers of depth and context to your videos, creating a better story. For some will be a way to improve their performance and for others will be a way to identify quickly the places they have been and document a cross-country road trip for example.

In this telemetry feature, you can find information such as:

- **Distance (km or miles):** See the route you took and pinpoint your position as you move along the path
- **Altitude:** Gain insights into your elevation above sea level, adding depth to your footage.
- **Elevation Gain:** Understand the vertical distance climbed during your activities, providing context to your adventures.
- **Date & time:** Document the exact moment, adding chronological significance to your footage.
- **Speedometer:** Insights into your pace during action-packed moments.

To be able to see these insights, you will need to use specialised [software](https://classermedia.com/) that can show you the GPS information to generate detailed maps, giving more context to your story.

Typically, more affordable options may lack this feature. Here's a rundown of action cameras that offer telemetry functionality:

### 1. GoPro

In the world of action cameras, GoPro has been a game-changer, letting users capture their adventures with incredible detail. And when it comes to telemetry features, GoPro has some standout models that really shine.

From GoPro Hero 5 Black to the latest Hero 11, users can tackle the power of GPS and sensor data to enrich their footage. These cameras seamlessly integrate telemetry data, allowing you to overlay vital information such as speed, altitude, and route details onto your videos.

However, it's essential to note that while GoPro cameras are brilliant at capturing telemetry data, there are some limitations to consider. For instance, users may experience reduced battery life when GPS is enabled, impacting the camera's longevity during extended recording sessions, although you can always switch GPS off when you don’t need it. Additionally, the accuracy of GPS data may vary depending on environmental factors such as signal strength and satellite availability.

Despite these limitations, GoPro remains a top choice for action enthusiasts seeking to boost their storytelling with telemetry features. Whether you're riding down mountain trails or flying through the sky, GoPro cameras ensure you capture every exciting moment with precision and clarity.

### 2. Insta360

Insta360 is shaking up the action camera scene with 360 footage that takes your adventures to the next level. When it comes to telemetry, Insta360 models let you capture insight data with Ace Pro, Ace, Go 3, X3, ONE RS, ONE X2, and ONE R.

For Insta360, their system is a bit different, it requires an [external remote](https://store.insta360.com/product/gps-action-remote) to send the GPS and sensor data (speed, altitude, etc) to the camera. This remote is sold separately and it can cost around £80. You can wear this device on your wrist or mount it to the handlebar and remotely start recording. This data will be integrated into your video.

What's cool about using telemetry with Insta360 cameras is that because it's an external remote, it has no impact on the battery life of the camera allowing you to enjoy the camera for longer.

### 3. DJI

You've probably heard of DJI for their drones, but did you know they're also going into the market for the action camera? The DJI Osmo Action 4 is proof of that.

With the DJI Osmo Action 4, you can capture all sorts of telemetry data; GPS, speed, and altitude. Like Insta360 it requires an [external remote](https://store.dji.com/uk/product/osmo-action-gps-bluetooth-remote-controller?vid=144561), and it costs around £70. The way it works is the same, you will be able to remotely start recording, and after the data will be integrated into your video.

### How to visualise this data?

Now, let’s talk how we can visualise this data. We’ve built this software called [Classer](https://classermedia.com/), but hold up, I'm not here to sell you anything. Instead, I want to share how Classer can take your adventures to the next level. We built this software to be your digital journal for action cams, that let you dive into the details of your footage, to create more impactful and unforgettable moments. Here’s how it works, import your local footage into the desktop app and you will be able to see the insights from your footage, provided your GPS was on during filming.

So, whether you're going for a big adventure or just love exploring new places, [Classer](https://classermedia.com/) can help you relive your moments in incredible detail which you can share later on with friends. It's about sharing a tool that can add a whole new layer of excitement to your adventures.

### Our conclusion

Telemetry features in action cameras aren't just a fancy add-on—they're a game-changer for adventure enthusiasts. From tracking your route while kayaking to monitoring your speed while cycling, telemetry adds an exciting dimension to your footage. Brands like GoPro, Insta360, and DJI are leading the charge with models that seamlessly integrate telemetry data, allowing you to relive your adventures in graphic detail. So, next time you're in the market for an action camera, consider the power of telemetry—it's not just nice to have, it's a must-have for capturing those special moments with an extra life of excitement.
