# We’ve done our research about the new Insta360 X4, is it worth it?

Insta360 has launched a new camera, “The ultimate 8K 60 Action Cam” called Insta360 X4. A fourth-generation model that's set to replace its predecessor, the Insta360 X3.

### The standouts:

- **Added replaceable standard lens** in the pack. Of course, you can pay extra for Premium Lens Guards
- The X4 has a 2,290 mAh battery, 67 percent bigger than the X3's, meaning has a longer battery life. According to the press release, it should be able to capture video for up to 135 minutes.
- The technical improvements focus on video, with the new ability to record footage at up to 8K 30fps or 5.7k at 60fps, increasing detail and quality.
- **X4 has higher frames rates for slow motion, up to 4K resolution**. Insta360’s Me Mode, which captures traditional ‘flat’ video (in combination with its ‘invisible’ selfie stick), has been upgraded to 4K 30fps. In short, it captures more of everything compared to its predecessor.
- **Waterproof to 33ft (10m)** and works in temperatures as low as -4°F (-20°C).
- New Insta360 X4 can record to 30 minutes with no gaps.

### The disappointments

- 8K creates more noise in low light but does have more detail
- Standard mode saturation and contrast are too high
- More color noise in low contrast areas, such as concrete
- It’s the same sensor size as X3.

### Summary

The [Insta360 X4](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&featureId=text-link&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmluc3RhMzYwLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0L3g0IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjNjgyMGFjYy1iZjE1LTQ5YzctOGFlMC0zNDMxYzQ1ZTNjYzYifQ&signature=AQAAAX6WFAR62zDfVzQ8NfFl6zg2bB0A0Kgb8ar1VLHQPtYT&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.insta360.com%2Fproduct%2Fx4&uuid=2fQa6QC4sjVSgBxT0156) doesn’t look hugely different from the X3. It has the same candy bar form factor, with two huge wide-angle lenses either side. If you are upgrading from an old camera probably is worth it, but from an X3? I’ll probably wait. 

For people interested, in the X4 is now available to order [directly from Insta360](https://www.insta360.com/product/insta360-x4), priced at $499.99. That *is* $100 more than its predecessor but still less than the company’s pro-level $800 camera, the One RS 1-inch 360 Edition.
