# Why we are building Classer

We are crazy about action cameras. It doesn’t mind if it’s a Gopro, a DJI, an Insta360, a SJCAM, an Akaso or any of the other low-cost brands, we love the memories that allow us to have. We take them to our mountain biking trips, when traveling or any new outdoor activity we try. But here's the thing: we have all these amazing recordings stored in our files, and they just feel lost. We wanted to create a space where we could easily relive our adventures, rewatch the craziness and get that itch to hit the trails again.

### **Our journey so far**

We had this idea a year ago, when we realised checking our adventures where a mess. We wanted to create a desktop - app focus, to tackle these specific struggles:

- Managing action camera videos are time consuming & boring task
- Not enough awareness of the powerful data action cameras have
- Absence of a unique platform to share content with your community

Since then, we came up with a roadmap, a plan to prioritise the key features, a lot of market research and a lot of late-night coding.

### **Community**

We spoke with other mountain bikers and we realised we weren’t alone. We started a community to share videos and most iconics jumps and trails. We wanted to be a spot where you not only stash your memories but also connect with others who get that same adrenaline rush. Share stories, swap tips, and keep the moments alive. 

### **Learn from others**

It’s exciting when you met other entrepreneurs. We met so many other entrepreneurs and builders where we learnt about their journey, their struggles and their achievements. Sharing stories has been our best school, and trust us, there's a lot more wisdom in those shared conversations than any business textbook (and we read lots!)

We've shared about the late-night coding sessions, the 'aha' moments that turned failures into wins, and the camaraderie that comes from hustling toward a shared dream. 

And as we continue this journey, we're not just building Classer; we're building on the collective wisdom of the entrepreneurial tribe. Cheers to learning, growing, and celebrating the journey together!
